# Kafka_Pub_Sub_ExcelRTDAddIn
To Launch publisher and consumer, you can use "LaunchPublisherConsumer.bat" file.

Once the publisher is running, you can open the "ExcelAddIn\HPExcelAddIn\HPExcelAddIn.sln" in administrator mode, and build it to get the AddIn registered.
Now you can open the "HPRTD_Demo.xlsx" (placed at the root folder) to get the value from Kafka using the RTDServer.
